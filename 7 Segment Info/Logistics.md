#### The First step was to create the Truth Table. Once I had the truth table and I knew the output would be accurate, I would need to simplify each segment for the 7-segment display to get the Boolean Expression ensuring I get the desired output.
#### To get accurate Boolean Expressions, I would next have to create the KMaps

#### Now that I have my Boolean Expressions, I would have to go into design my circuit and simulate it to make that everything is ok before I get my logic gates.
#### If everything is ok, I could then get my components. Now and only now do I begin to build the physical circuit.
#### Last step would be to trouble shoot any issues and make sure that everything is very similar to the simulation that I ran beforehand.
